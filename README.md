# Toolz aka Unit Converter

There are a lot of unit converter calculator apps on the market. However, most are inconvenient and difficult to use because of poor and complicated UI.
This conversion app has intuitive and simple UI, that is designed for casual user.

I've sorted units in groups; i.e., Matric System, Imperial System(US) and Imperial System(UK). There are plans to add many more system and Units in future.

The Different units that are supoported by the App include

# Volume: 
- units are millilitre, centilitre, decilitre, litre, hectolitre, cubic metre, U.S. fluid ounce, U.S. gill, U.S. cup, U.S. liquid pint, U.S. liquid quart, U.S. liquid gallon and U.S. barrel.  Also imperial ounce, gill, pint, quart, gallon and barrel.

# Temperature: 
- units are °Celsius, °Fahrenheit, Kelvin and Rankine 

# Weight: 
- units are milligram (mg), gram (g), kilogram (kg), zentner (ztr), tonne (t), grain (gr), dram (dr), ounce (oz), troy ounce (oz t), pound (lb), quarter (qtr), hundredweight (cwt) and short ton (sh. tn.) 

# Length: 
- units are millimetre (mm), centimetre (cm), decimetre (dm), metre (m), kilometre(km), inch (in), foot (ft), yard (yd), mile (mi) and nautical mile (sm). 

# Time:
- units are milliseconds (ms), seconds (s),  minutes (min), hours (h), days (d) and years (y)

# Speed:
- km/h, mph, m/s, km/s, knot, km/min, speed of sound, speed of light
